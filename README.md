# Carteado Challenges website

Carteado Challenges is one of the most traditional organizers of Pok√©mon TCG online tournaments. As its general manager and co-foundator, I've decided to build an actual website.

- Getting experience with SCSS, HTML, SEO, acessibility and, posteriorly, React and React Router.

# Technologies 

- React (^18.2.0);
- React Router (^6.4.3);
- Styled Components (^5.3.6);
- TypeScript (^4.9.3).
